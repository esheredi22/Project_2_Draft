How does the SARS-CoV-2 virus combat protein against the human immune system compare to the combat protein of the chosen zoonotic viruses (rabies lyssavirus, MERS-CoV, and the West Nile virus)? Are there conserved regions among these zoonotic viruses that allow for them to fight off the human immune system while further spreading their infection?
